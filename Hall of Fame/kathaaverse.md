# KathaaVerse on Hacker News

My project, Kathaaverse.com, made waves on Hacker Newsâ€”a platform owned by Y Combinator, widely regarded as one of the world's top startup incubators. 
It climbed to #5 on the overall HN front page and hit #1 on the Show HN section, earning enthusiastic feedback from the community. 
This happened on 30 July 2025, but the buzz and screenshots below capture its timeless impact.
